		<p>
			At the bottom of the well lies the Source. Love bubbles up infinite and pure as our shadow
			oozes down to pool on the surface.
		</p>
		<p>
			Left untended our shadow can taint anything we try to create, any choice we make, any words we
			say.
		</p>
		<p>
			To clear the way from the Source to the World, each day we can dip our psychic quills in that
			inky syrup and draw our shadow into the light.
