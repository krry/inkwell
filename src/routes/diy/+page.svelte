	<h2 class="gradient-heading">How to Set Up for Ink Well</h2>
	<p>
		First, you will need somewhere to draw. A pen and paper will do, or watercolors, markers,
		whatever you like. I love to use Procreate on my iPad with <a
			href="https://paperlike.com/collections/ipad-accessories"
			class="text-surface-500">Paperlike's</a
		> screen cover and magic pencil grip. As the artist, you of course choose the canvas, the muse, and
		the tools you will use. You will also need at least 5 minutes. On some days we find that completing
		this ritual takes half an hour. You will know when to proceed and when the ritual is complete by
		a subtle feeling of relief somewhere within you.

			We draw a circle in the center of the canvas. Here we hold space for intention.

			Then we divide the rest of the canvas into four equal quadrants. Most Inkwellers prefer
			landscape orientation. One could draw perpendicular bisecting lines, or fold the paper in half
			one way then the other.

			Each quadrant represents one of the four base elements of creation. The receptive elements lay
			to the left, while the active elements pose on the right, and the spiritual elements sit atop
			the material elements. Meanwhile in the center waits the

	<blockquote>
		<p class="text-surface-700-200-token">
			Deep within us there sits a well. A well without a bottom, the well of being, some say. Diving
			in, we begin to fathom the Source from whence raw love bubbles forth. A foamy froth forms on
			the surface. With our two tools, attention and intent, we shape the foam of love. When the
			foam is in-formation, we are ready to share our creation. We share the love we shape through
			words and deeds, movement and speech. But the love we seek to share often comes with a taint.
			We witness our best intentions mangled and stained by some unseen force. For in that well of
			being, our shadow pools unseen, trickling down behind the mind's eye. The inky syrup of fear
			lurks murky, coating love's bubbles in image and appearance, film and scum. To bring purer
			forms of love into the world, we must first draw out our shadow. May as well use the ink well.
