		When we Ink Well, we draw our shadow into the light. Here this practice is presented as a
		meditative ritual, repeatable daily. You may find that this practice fits well at the start of
		your day, like Julia Cameronâ€™s morning pages from The Artist's Way. I often like to aim for
		sunrise or sunset, and brew a cup of coffee or tea before I sit down to Ink Well.
