		<strong>Deep within us there sits a well.</strong>
		A well without a bottom the well of being, some say.

		Diving in, we begin to fathom the Source
		from whence raw love bubbles forth.
		A foamy froth forms on the surface.

		With our two tools, attention and intent,
		we shape the foam of love.

		When the foam is in-formation,
		we are ready to share our creation.

		We share the love we shape
		through words and deeds,
		movement and speech.

		But the love we seek to share
		often comes with a taint.
		We witness our best intentions
		mangled and stained
		by some unseen force.

		For in that well of being,
		our shadow pools unseen,
		trickling down behind the mind's eye.

		The inky syrup of fear lurks murky,
		coating love's bubbles
		in scum and film,
		image and appearance.

		To bring purer forms of love into the world,
		we must first draw out our shadow.

		<strong>May as well use the ink wellâ€¦</strong>
